		question: 'Where will I sit in the boat, and who sails the boat?',
		answer:
			'Our participants with disabilities are the ones who do the sailing. No prior sailing experience needed. Our 2-person sailboats are specifically designed for adaptive sailing. The participant sits in the front seat and controls the steering and sails, while the volunteer companion sailor sits in back giving guidance as needed. We conduct a short briefing at the dock to introduce basic concepts and boat parts, and then the adaptive sailor and companion sailor head out to sail on San Diego Bay.'

Our volunteers can't take responsibility for service animals or pets."
	},
	{
		question: 'Does a volunteer need sailing experience?',
		answer:
			'We welcome volunteers with any level of experience. Volunteers with previous sailing experience can receive training to become Companion sailors, so they can accompany our participants in the boats. People with little or no sailing experience can start by assisting on the docks, and progress from there. We also welcome volunteers who wish to help with fundraising, outreach, and other off-the-water aspects of our program.'
