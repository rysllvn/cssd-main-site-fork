		bio: "Sam Graber is originally from Washington, D.C. but grew up sailing during summers in the NY Adirondacks on Upper Saranac Lake when his Mom forced him to get on the damn boat. Now he's a crazy foredecker, never reefs and sails his own Catalina 22 without a motor. But he is VERY responsible with CSSD as a companion sailor. Sam is thrilled to be using his time and talents to serve the disabled community. Every day is a joy when we can give the gift of making memories on the water while being powered by the wind. Let's go sailing!",

		name: 'Eric Matus',
		title: 'Director',
		bio: 'In 2018 I was in a paragliding accident resulting in an L1 burst fracture and bruised spinal cord.  After recovering enough to use a walker I visited Challenged Sailors SD and was lifted into a Martin 16.  Once I realized I could sail again I began to sail regularly.  This led to my applying my 60 years of sailing experience to qualify as a Chase Boat Operator, ASA and US Sailing Basic Keelboat Instructor.  I also rewrote the CSSD Basic Sailing Manual and authored Chase Boat Operator and Dock Leader Manuals.  I now own and race a Schock Santana 525, a 25-foot sailboat along with participating and volunteering with Challenged Sailors.',
