	{
		question: 'Where will I sit in the boat, and who sails the boat?',
		answer:
			'Our participants with disabilities are the ones who do the sailing. No prior sailing experience needed. Our 2-person sailboats are specifically designed for adaptive sailing. The participant sits in the front seat and controls the steering and sails, while the volunteer companion sailor sits in back giving guidance as needed. We conduct a short briefing at the dock to introduce basic concepts and boat parts, and then the adaptive sailor and companion sailor head out to sail on San Diego Bay.'
	},
	{
		question: 'How do I know if I will like sailing?',
		answer:
			"Sailing can be a calm, soothing experience, or it can be an exciting adventure, depending on the wind and the way you want to approach it. Come give it a try … we'll do everything we can to help you have a wonderful day on the water!"
	},
	{
		question: 'Can my dog come with me?',
		answer:
			"Due to space and safety constraints we can't have service animals on the boats. Sorry! They are welcome at the head of the dock, if you have a friend, family member or aide who can care for your service animal while you are sailing. Our volunteers can't take responsibility for service animals or pets."
	},
	{
		question: 'Does a volunteer need sailing experience?',
		answer:
			'We welcome volunteers with any level of experience. Volunteers with previous sailing experience can receive training to become Companion sailors, so they can accompany our participants in the boats. People with little or no sailing experience can start by assisting on the docks, and progress from there. We also welcome volunteers who wish to help with fundraising, outreach, and other off-the-water aspects of our program.'
	},
	{
		question: "What is the organization's structure?",
		answer:
